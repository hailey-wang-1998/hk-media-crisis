    <div class="sticky-text">In 2020, China imposed a law on Hong Kong that cracked down on free speech and political opposition. The law gave authorities broad powers to silence dissent, driving many media outlets out of the city and forcing journalists to censor themselves.</div> <br>

  <section class="narrative">
    <p>Each day, Hong Kong’s iconic Ding Ding tram weaves through the city's contrasting landscapes. It glides through narrow streets flanked by aging residential blocks before emerging into modern business towers.</p>
    <p>In the heart of the city, residents pass a bold command painted on the side of a tram that translates to:</p>
    <p>“Firmly adhere to Article 23 of the Basic Law”</p>
    <img class="narrative-image" src="assets/example-media/tram.jpg" alt="Hong Kong Tram Scene">
    <figcaption class="image-caption">A tram in Hong Kong carries the slogan “Firmly adhere to Article 23” (堅定維護憲法基本法) on its side. It's a law that has forced residents and journalists censor themselves.</figcaption>
    <p>The same slogan appears across buses, subways and transit stations, a steady reminder of Beijing’s expanding reach.</p>
    <p>It’s a law passed just over a year ago to expand national security legislation that aimed to limit speech in Hong Kong. The law stems from China’s desire to restrict Hong Kong’s autonomy and to clamp down on free speech. It has forced journalists into silence, driven out foreign media , and left the local press under immense pressure to self-censor, weighing every word for fear of being arrested. </p>
    <p>For instance, mentions of the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown in search results on HK01, a Hong Kong-based digital media platform, plunged nearly 90% after China imposed a sweeping national security law on the city in 2020, a data analysis shows.</p>
    <p>Years ago, journalists in Hong Kong could report on incidents like the 2019 Yuen Long mob attack, where over 100 men assaulted commuters, journalists and pro-democracy protesters inside a subway station, while police were slow to respond. </p>
    <p>Today, pursuing such a story that criticizes government officials could lead to arrest, as it did for journalist Bao Choy, who was prosecuted for accessing public records during her investigation on the incident. The shift reflects not only a crackdown on press freedom but also a deeper encroachment on Hong Kong’s autonomy.</p>
    </section>

    <img class="fullscreen-image" src="assets/example-media/DSC07600.jpg" alt="Hong Kong Subway Scene">
    <figcaption class="image-caption">The slogan promoting Beijing’s authority over Hong Kong is everywhere across the city, including this subway station.</figcaption>
    <section class="narrative">
    <p>Yet beneath the tram’s steel tracks and the slogans they carry, a quiet resistance remains — fighting to uphold freedom of speech the best way they can. A handful of journalists from Hong Kong continue to report, striving to keep Hong Kong’s voice alive.</p>
    <p>Even under the risk of being arrested, some refuse to give up.</p>
    <p>Kris Lau is one of them.</p>
    <p>“I have been a reporter for over a decade, working in both broadcast and digital journalism,” he said. “I loved the work and felt comfortable across platforms. But now … I just can’t align with the values of mainstream media. They’re no longer fighting for what journalism truly stands for.”</p>
    <img class="narrative-image" src="assets/example-media/IMG_1664.JPG" alt="Kris Protrait">
    <figcaption class="image-caption">Kris Lau, founder of the independent bookstore, Have A Nice Stay, and former <em>Stand News</em> journalist.</figcaption>
    <p>He was the only employee present in the newsroom when Hong Kong police raided <em>Stand News</em> back in 2021. Known for its pro-democracy editorial stance, <em>Stand News</em> was one of the city’s most prominent independent news outlets. At its peak, it ranked first among Hong Kong’s online news media in both 2016 and 2019.</p>
    <p>He still remembers the moment he arrived at the office that morning to find more than 100 officers waiting outside. Some were in uniform, others in plainclothes.</p>
    <p>They asked him to unlock the office door, then confined him to a room and ordered him to power off his phone. Two officers stood watch to ensure he didn’t take any action. Meanwhile, others stormed through the office, boxing up laptops, desktop computers and any documents they could find before taking everything away.</p>
    <p>The same day, Hong Kong police arrested its two editors on charges of “conspiracy to publish seditious publications” — a rarely used and vaguely defined offense that authorities began enforcing more aggressively after the National Security Law, or NSL, took effect.</p>
    <p>Lau  — like many other journalists — was forced to leave the industry when <em>Stand News</em> was shut down as the authority froze its assets. With newsrooms, including <em>Stand News</em>,<em> Apple Daily</em>, and <em>Citizen News</em> gone, at least 900 journalists have lost their jobs according to statistics from Reporters Without Borders. <em>Apple Daily</em>, once the city’s first full-color newspaper and a cornerstone of the pro-democracy media landscape, was also ranked as Hong Kong’s third most trusted news outlet before its forced closure in 2021.</p>
    <p>When he talks about his years as a journalist, Lau’ eyes still light up, but the optimism is gone.</p>
    <p>“Hong Kong is not the same anymore,” he said. “I don’t think there’s any room left for Hong Kong reporters now.”</p>
    <p>Still, he refuses to leave Hong Kong. Lau, like other journalists, sought refuge in other ventures, only to find themselves under threat again. He opened a bookstore, selling what authorities call 'banned books'—though many are simply works by activists or historical accounts of social movements.</p>
    <p>In helping others remember the once free city, Lau finds a reason to stay. </p>

    <p>Lau tries to keep a lower profile, but still helps younger reporters behind the scenes. He helps edit their stories, introduces them to sources and offers guidance. He wants to keep the nature and scope of his work private out of fear of police raiding his bookstore like what they did to his newsroom.</p>
    <p>The bookstore has become a kind of underground haven, or a safe space where his former colleagues, many from now-defunct outlets like the <em>Stand News</em>, gather to talk about the Hong Kong they once knew. On the walls hang yellowed pages of the city’s past, including a front page from <em>Apple Daily</em> with the 2019 protest slogan:</p>
    <p>“Hongkongers, stand up for yourselves!”</p>
    <p>The bookstore is hidden on the third floor of an unmarked building, invisible from street level. It’s tucked away in a cramped loft, and — for now — just out of reach of two laws reshaping the city.</p>

    <p style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 1.4rem;">Two laws, One Outcome</p>
    <p>The attacks on free speech in Hong Kong began with the NSL, imposed by Beijing in 2020. The law criminalized acts of treason, secession, sedition, subversion against the central government, and the theft of state secrets.</p>
    <p>But this wasn’t enough for the Chinese government.</p>

    <figcaption class="image-caption">Chinese and Hong Kong flags displayed side by side, reflecting Beijing’s growing influence over the city.</figcaption>
    <p>Under Article 7 of the NSL, Hong Kong was obligated to complete its own national security legislation as outlined in the Basic Law. In March 2024, the city fulfilled that requirement by passing its own security law under Article 23, widely viewed as the final piece in Beijing’s security framework.</p>
    <p>Article 23 expanded the list of offenses and granted authorities sweeping new powers, including the ability to ban organizations deemed national security threats and detain suspects for extended periods without charge.</p>
    <p>For instance, under Article 23, simply possessing a publication deemed seditious , such as a book about past protests or speeches by dissidents, now carries a maximum sentence of three years, up from one year previously.</p>

    <p>The two laws target acts with broad public or media influence, including sedition and subversion against the central government. Sedition can mean posting a protest slogan online, displaying a political banner, or sharing articles that criticize the Chinese Communist Party. And subversion has already been used to charge activists involved in the Hong Kong 47 case — one of the city’s largest national security trials.</p>
    <p>In that case, 47 pro-democracy politicians and activists were arrested for organizing an unofficial primary election in 2020. The goal of the vote was to coordinate candidates across districts and boost the pro-democracy camp’s chances of winning a majority in the upcoming Legislative Council election. Authorities accused the effort of being part of a broader strategy to undermine state power and  framed it as a violation of the NSL.</p>
    <p>Of the 47 defendants, 45 were convicted and sentenced to four to 10 years in prison in 2024. And under Article 23, defendants convicted under the NSL are no longer eligible for the one-third sentence reduction typically granted for good behavior in prison.</p>
    <p>Together, these two laws, NSL and Article 23, forced newspapers to censor themselves and drove out journalists.</p>

    <p>An analysis of more than 20,000 of <em>HK01</em> articles found that about 950 articles mentioned “June 4” between 2018 and 2024,  with mentions plunging after Beijing imposed the NSL.</p>
    <p>Before the law, the platform published between 130 and 280 stories annually that appeared in search results for the term. That number fell to fewer than 80 starting in 2022, just after a year under the law and the shutdown of <em>Apple Daily</em> and <em>Stand News</em>.</p>
    <p>And in 2024, June 4th was only mentioned 30.</p>
    <p>Years ago, Hong Kong newsrooms published in-depth reports marking the anniversary of the June 4th Tiananmen Square crackdown, an event widely seen as a symbol of the city’s distinct political identity and role in preserving historical memory.</p>
    <p>But after the NSL took effect in 2020, coverage of the event sharply declined.</p>

    <p>Blair, a reporter at a pro-democracy independent newsroom, spoke on condition of anonymity due to security concerns. She said that at previous newsrooms she worked for, editors never explicitly ordered cuts. Instead, political reporters were quietly reassigned to other stories that day. Even when articles were published, they were buried in less prominent sections, and sensitive terms, like “June 4th”, were often removed from headlines.</p>
    <p>Dennis Leung, assistant professor at Hong Kong Shue Yan University’s Department of Journalism and Communication, said the decline in coverage stems from two factors.</p>
    <p>Public vigils held annually in Hong Kong became harder to organize after the NSL, leaving fewer events for the media to cover. At the same time, news outlets have also increasingly practiced self-censorship, scaling back reports on the topic, he said.</p>
    <p>In mainland China, issues related to Xinjiang and Tibet are considered politically taboo, as they involve questions of ethnic autonomy, human rights and separatism. These topics are considered to challenge Beijing’s narrative of national unity and are tightly controlled in state media.</p>
    <p>Mentions of these politically sensitive terms have also declined, data shows. Before the NSL was enacted, “Tibet” appeared in headlines or lead paragraphs more than 110 times a year. By 2024, that number had dropped to just 35. Also, searches for "Xinjiang" on <em>HK01</em> yield no results older than 40 months — a restriction not seen with other keywords.</p>
    <p>References to “Xinjiang” fell steadily year after year. The term appeared in more than 400 headlines in 2021, dropped to 250 in 2022, and fell below 200 by 2023.</p>
    <p>Still, Leung reminded that the decline may not be entirely political, as the analysis counted any article mentioning “Xinjiang” or “Tibet,” regardless of whether the content was political in nature.</p>

    <p>The impact of Hong Kong is spreading beyond the region. Under the growing pressure of Article 23, more foreign media outlets are leaving the city.<em> Radio Free Asia</em> pulled all staff from Hong Kong and closed its office in April 2024, with some employees relocating to Taiwan.</p>
    <p>That May, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> followed, moving its Asian headquarters from Hong Kong to Singapore. Now, when visiting their original offices in Hong Kong, the door was locked with chains and nothing was left.</p>
    <img class="narrative-image" src="assets/example-media/IMG_0918.JPG" alt="Empty Office">
    <figcaption class="image-caption">The former Wall Street Journal office in Hong Kong sits empty and locked, visible only through a narrow gap in the door.</figcaption>
    <p>Hong Kong once served as a hub for foreign news outlets, offering proximity to Beijing and a freer environment to report on China, along with its status as a global financial center with a vibrant cultural scene. But under the growing pressure of Article 23, more international media companies are shifting their regional offices to safer locations like Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea.</p>
    <p>“The situation has worsened, with foreign correspondents increasingly barred from Hong Kong as authorities tighten control,” said Aleksandra Bielakowska, Advocacy Officer at Reporters Without Borders in Taipei.</p>
    <p>Bielakowska explained that Article 23, which introduces harsher sedition penalties, is deepening the climate of fear by targeting publications directly — something the original NSL did not do. Media outlets remaining in the region are increasingly self-censoring and limited in scope, and that explains the drastic drop in Hong Kong’s ranking in press freedom. </p>
    <p>“The decline is unparalleled, and it’s clear that the territory is becoming the next victim of the Chinese Communist Party’s reach,” Bielakowska added.</p>

    <p>“It’s not just about how the laws have changed, it’s more about the atmosphere,” said Jeff, who requested anonymity for security reasons."After NSL, media workers believe that if (the authority) is trying to do something against you, no matter what the norm is, they can find a way to criminalize you."</p>
    <p>Jeff was sentenced to 11 months in prison after being convicted of conspiring to publish seditious materials under NSL. Now out of the media industry, he has witnessed the rise and fall of Hong Kong’s press firsthand and holds insights into its transformation over the past five years.</p>
    <p>He said journalists in Hong Kong now avoid interviewing sensitive figures, steering clear of anything political. For example, in court reporting, reporters now refrain from speaking with defendants. In cases like the Hong Kong 47 trial, mainstream media have mostly avoided interviewing the accused, fearing it could provoke authorities. While these figures may still be mentioned in narratives, reporters no longer reach out to them directly to get their side of the story.</p>
    <p>Even outlets that once leaned liberal have scaled back sharply on political coverage. Profile stories on activists, opposition figures and other sensitive subjects have largely disappeared, as many of those individuals have already fled the city or avoided speaking to the media. The risk of government retaliation has made such reporting too dangerous.</p>
    <p>Investigative political journalism has also faded.</p>
    <p>Reporters say it’s increasingly difficult to find voices that are against the authority, and few are willing to speak on the record. As a result, much of the news now reflects only official narratives. While some journalists still comment on minor legal details, broader critiques of government policy have become off-limits. With so little room to operate, many newsrooms are staying away from any kind of  political reporting.</p>
    <p>“If you only consume mainstream media, you can only get one side of the story, which is whatever the official narrative says,” Jeff added that the atmosphere has long been like this since 2020, when the NSL was passed.</p>
    <img class="narrative-image" src="assets/example-media/DSC07401.jpg" alt="Hong Kong newspapers">
    <figcaption class="image-caption">Since <em>Apple Daily</em>'s shutdown, pro-democracy newspapers have mostly disappeared from Hong Kong newsstands.</figcaption>
 
    <p>Another striking shift is how censorship has evolved from a restriction to a form of protection. In the past, Hong Kong media paid little attention to censorship—reporters saw it as a barrier that limited their ability to pursue stories they were passionate about.</p>
    <p>But now, most journalists practice self-censorship, even referring to it as “love censorship.” Unlike traditional government imposed restrictions, this type of censorship is practiced voluntarily — not out of fear alone, but out of consideration for those involved. Reporters avoid certain words or images not just to protect themselves, but to shield their interviewees, editors and colleagues from potential legal consequences.</p>
    <p>Sensitive interviewees often remind reporters to grant them anonymity to protect the reporters, while journalists carefully consider their wording and photo selection before publishing, wary of putting their newsrooms at risk after the crackdowns on <em>Apple Daily</em> and <em>Stand News</em>.</p>
    <p>For instance, the flag printing “Hong Kong Independence” is highly risky. Even in independent and pro-democracy newsrooms, they took down any photos with such flags.</p>
    <p>Lily, who requested anonymity for security reasons, a reporter at a pro-democracy newsroom, admitted that censorship has become increasingly visible since the NSL was enacted, both top-down through editorial directives, and bottom-up as reporters self-censor to avoid legal risk. When covering sensitive topics, “the bottom line is to include the official talking point,”  she said, to ensure that reporters can defend their work even in the face of future legal scrutiny.</p>
    <p>For example, there were a series of protests at Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2019, part of the pro-democracy demonstrations, where students clashed with police over concerns that the proposed extradition law would erode Hong Kong's autonomy.</p>
    <p>When covering the anniversary of such events, Lily noted, reporters might describe the police as becoming aggressive, but they must also include statements from officials, such as the secretary for security, who referred to the protests as a “defensive battle” against violent protesters. “You can’t just label it as police violence; you have to frame it as a peaceful defense,” she said.</p>
    <p>Despite this, Blair and Lily continue to report under constant fear, uncertain whether their own newsroom could face the same fate as <em>Apple Daily</em> and <em>Stand News</em>.</p>
    <p>“I tried to quit. I don’t think the environment here is good for a reporter anymore, but I can’t,” Blair said. “I still want to fight for the voice here. I want to work for the Hongkongers.”</p>

    <p>They believe it's only a matter of time before their newsroom is shut down once its readership grows and its impact becomes too significant. But before this, they will keep Hong Kong’s voice alive.</p>
    <p>After a tour of the vacant newsrooms — a reporter pointed out an ad on the tram to Lau, asking if he noticed it. “Did you notice that ad on the tram? The one that looks like propaganda?”</p>
    <p>“Huh? I didn’t even see it,” Lau said with a sigh. “They’ve become part of the background now.”</p>
    <p>The two laws have become so embedded in daily life that many Hongkongers no longer notice what’s changed — even Lau. Protests are rare. Keywords like “June 4th” and “Hong Kong independence” have vanished from news headlines.</p>
    <p>But for the quiet resistance, the memory of a more liberal Hong Kong remains vivid,  and that’s what keeps them here.</p>
    <p>None of them have left the city.</p>
    <p>They say they stay not because it’s safe or easy, but because they remember what it once was. And even under censorship, they continue — in small, quiet ways — to tell Hong Kong’s story.</p>
